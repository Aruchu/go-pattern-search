# Waltheri's go pattern search

This repository serves as a public place for [Waltheri's go pattern search](http://ps.waltheri.net) web app. For now you can post here a bug report, feature request or manage translations.

## Localization

The newest version of the pattern search (v3) can be translated into any languages. A guide how to do it is here. You can send me localization file on email thebestgoplayer@gmail.com, however I would prefer if you use GitHub pull request.
